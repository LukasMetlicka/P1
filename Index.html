				<h1 class="q1"> In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do. </h1>
				<p> I am a high school student at the Boston Latin School. In my free time, I do Improv and shoot movies with friends. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="q2">
				<h1 class="q2"> Why are you taking this course? </h1>
				<p> I am looking to learn more about advanced languages and their capabilities. I think that these languages will help in the future, as web 		development is both a marketable skill and one that is enjoyable.  In web development, the line between programming and art is more blurry, and a beautiful web page can be so much more than a vessel for information.</p>

			<div class="q3">
				<h1 class="q3"> What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS? </h1>
				<p> Last summer I took a course at Lesley University on website design</p>

			<div class="q4">
				<h1 class="q4"> What previous experience do you have with programming? </h1>
				<p>I've experimented some with programs like python and javascript, as well as taking a course at Lesley University.</p>

			<div class="q5">
				<h1 class="q5"> Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent? </h1>
				<p> I haven't worked with it yet, but I am excited to do so!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q6">
				<h1 class="q6"> Describe your level of experience with programming. </h1>
				<p>Very primitive. I understand what objects are, and I understand the concepts behind programming, but in terms of raw experience, I am very limited.</p> 
			</div>
			<div class="q7">
				<h1 class="q7"> Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform? </h1>
				<p> Mac all the way!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q8">
				<h1 class="q8"> Anything else we should know? </h1>
				<p>This summer I am working at the Museum of Science as an intern for the web development team. I am hoping this will both help my learning in class, and that my learning will help me in the workplace.</p>
